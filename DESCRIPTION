Description: This package is an interactive analysis platform that enables the users to detect and track
  fluorescently-labeled single molecules scanning a linear substrates. In a typical experiment to collect a few
  number of short-lived interactions, large number of frames are recorded. Finding the spatio-temporal address of
  those events of target is the challenge that this package helps solving. Prior to analysis using this platform,
  all the existing signals in the recorded images need to be localized in 'FIJI' using a single molecule localization
  plug-in called 'ThunderSTORM'.
