# SMITracker

![](images/clipboard-2249885403.png)

This package is an interactive analysis platform that enables the users to detect and track fluorescently-labeled single molecules scanning a linear substrates. In a typical experiment to collect a few number of short-lived interactions, large number of frames are recorded. Finding the spatio-temporal coordinates of those events of target is the challenge that this package helps solving. Prior to analysis using this platform, all the existing signals in the recorded images need to be localized in 'FIJI' using a single molecule localization plug-in called 'ThunderSTORM'.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SMITracker from github, follow the steps below:

1.  Install the remote package, If you do not already have it:

``` r

install.packages("remotes")
```

2.  Now you can install SMITracker package from GitHub, the current GitHub repo is on UIO Enterprise version (potentially need to be fixed later)

``` r

remotes::install_github("https://github.uio.no/dScience/SMITracker.git")
```

## Example

This package can be called using library function in R and afterwards the interface is launched by simply running run_app() function.

``` r
library(SMITracker)

run_app()
```

For more detailed information on how to analyse your data using the interface refer to the original paper explaining the package.
